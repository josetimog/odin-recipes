    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        Chicken Tinola is a Filipino soup dish. It involves cooking chicken 
        pieces in ginger broth. It is a popular cold weather dish. 
        I always feel warm and cozy every time I eat it. 
        This Filipino Chicken Soup is best enjoyed with fish sauce as 
        dipping sauce, and a cup of warm white rice.
