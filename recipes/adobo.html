        Filipino Chicken Adobo is the national dish of the Philippines 
        and may well become your new favourite Asian chicken dish! 
        Just a few everyday ingredients I can practically guarantee 
        you already have, it is an effortless recipe that yields juicy, 
        tender chicken coated in a sweet savoury glaze with little pops 
        of heat from peppercorns.
